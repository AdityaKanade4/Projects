I completed a project on plant leaf segmentation, focusing on isolating the leaf from the entire image for further analysis. The project involved preprocessing techniques like resizing, filtering, and cropping images to ensure optimal segmentation results. I utilized machine learning and image processing algorithms to accurately differentiate between the leaf and the background, which is essential for subsequent tasks like disease classification. The project demonstrated my ability to apply technical skills in image processing, feature extraction, and machine learning, contributing to more efficient analysis in agricultural applications.
