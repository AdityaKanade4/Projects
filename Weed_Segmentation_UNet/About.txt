I worked on a project focused on crop weed segmentation of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) images using the UNet deep learning model. This project involved processing aerial imagery to distinguish between crops and weeds, which is critical for precision agriculture. The UNet architecture was employed for its effectiveness in semantic segmentation, allowing the identification of pixel-level differences between crops and weeds. By accurately segmenting these images, the project aimed to improve the efficiency of weed control, leading to more sustainable farming practices. This work demonstrated my expertise in image segmentation, deep learning, and agricultural applications.
