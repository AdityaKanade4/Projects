We developed a project on plant leaf disease classification that categorizes leaves into healthy and non-healthy types. For non-healthy leaves, the system further identifies the specific type of disease present. The project utilized machine learning algorithms to process and analyze images of plant leaves, enabling accurate classification of disease types. This system can assist farmers and agricultural experts in early disease detection and management, improving crop health and yield. The project demonstrates strong skills in machine learning, image processing, and data analysis, as well as a practical application in the agricultural sector.
